My first attempt to create a synth plugin for Ardour
The first thing we need to do is to establish what i want to make. (Functional Design)
The second thing is to design the wire frame for the plugin. (Visual Design)
And last but not least how to code it all on the technical side (Technical Design) 
Maybe it's smart to get to know Ardour first before start coding something for the program. The VST should cater my needs.

Second test, i need to stop typing my password twice
